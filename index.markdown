Hey there, I’m Soham, a 28-year-old hailing from the charming town of Kalna near Kolkata, famous for its mouthwatering "makhs sandesh" sweets. If you ever pass by, consider yourself invited to experience our warm community.

Currently, I’m deep into my Master’s journey in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence at Saarland University, navigating through my fifth semester and diving headfirst into my thesis. Feel free to delve into my research page for more insights.

Professionally, I’m a computer engineer and researcher, specializing in the realms of computer vision and ML. Certified in deep learning, I've extensively explored these fields in both my professional and research endeavors. I'm particularly intrigued by the intersection of classical algorithms and modern ML methods, recognizing a bridge waiting to be built between them.I have gotten to learn so much about these topics at the university . So if you have some interesting project I would love to hear about it. 

On a personal note, I’m a curious soul with a passion for exploration. Whether it's marveling at sunsets, cruising on my bike during spring, or embarking on spontaneous adventures, I find joy in life's simple pleasures.Life at the university fuels my passion, especially when it comes to sports. Tennis, in particular, holds a special place in my heart, teaching me invaluable life lessons. As a supporter of FC Saarbruecken and a lifelong fan of Liverpool FC, sports hold a significant role in my life.
In my downtime, I’m a movie buff and music aficionado, often finding myself lost in the world of entertainment. I welcome every moment of this journey called life, cherishing the ordinary and embracing the extraordinary with open arms.

If you ever feel like diving into my world, check out my posts. I try to update them whenever I break free from bouts of laziness. You’ll also find my other pages conveniently listed in the header. If you're up for an adventure, count me in—I’m always ready to explore new horizons and create lasting memories.

Hey there, I’m Soham, a 28-year-old hailing from the charming town of Kalna near Kolkata in East India

Currently, I’m deep into my Master’s journey in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence at Saarland University, navigating through my fifth semester and into my thesis on texture synthesis. Feel free to delve into my other page for more insights.

Professionally, I’m a computer engineer and researcher, specializing in the realms of computer vision and ML. Certified in deep learning, I've extensively explored these fields in both my professional and research endeavors. I'm particularly intrigued by the intersection of classical algorithms and modern ML methods, recognizing a bridge waiting to be built between them. I have gotten to learn and research on them so much at the university . 

On a personal note, I’m a curious soul with a passion for exploration. Whether it's marveling at sunsets, cruising on my bike during spring, or embarking on spontaneous adventures, I find joy in life's simple pleasures.Life at the university fuels my passion, especially when it comes to sports. Tennis, in particular, holds a special place in my heart, teaching me invaluable life lessons. As a supporter of FC Saarbruecken and a lifelong fan of Liverpool FC, sports hold a significant role in my life.
In my downtime, I’m a movie buff and music aficionado, often finding myself lost in the world of entertainment. I welcome every moment of this journey called life, cherishing the ordinary and embracing the extraordinary with open arms.

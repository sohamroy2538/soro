<span style="font-size:larger;"> Since my undergraduate studies, I was drawn to the forefront of research and the latest technological advancements, eager to contribute to the community. Fortunately, I had the opportunity to collaborate with professors on research projects. Exploring topics like computer vision, sensor nodes, machine learning, and algorithms became more than just academic pursuits—they became passions. I am sincerely grateful for the opportunities I've been given and the trust bestowed upon me by my professors, allowing me to engage in meaningful contributions to the field. Here's a list of my research works . Feel free to explore the topics and paper if you are interested </span>

- ## Application of computer vision/ ML in Microstructure Analysis · (Ongoing Masters Thesis)
    ![Fracture in surfaces](..\images\image_thesis.png)


    I am writing my masters thesis on the
    domain of application of computer vision/Machine learning in the
    manufacturing domain, specific to the Steel Industry. More specifically I am going to study the
    occurence of multiple types of fractures and artefacts on steel surfaces that arise in manufacturing and testing of the structure, and 
    localise /segment them for end user use. cyrrently this task requires expert
    and manual analysis and I am looking ways to exploit algorithms to automate
    this task. **The above example shows the types of images I am dealing with**.


- ## A Fast and Effective Machine Learning Approach for Road Cracks Classification · [Paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10039911)
  ###  IEEE · Feb 16, 2023 

    ![Crack Classification](..\images\road_classification.png)

    This paper proposes a machine learning-driven approach to effectively detect and classify road cracks, crucial for preventing potential accidents. Our straightforward pipeline, compared with state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models, showcases competitive results. Notably, the Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) feature selector outperforms others, yielding a high accuracy of ∼97% when combined with the Optuna-tuned Random Forest Classifier, thus offering a promising solution for road safety enhancement.



- ## A Siamese Neural Network-based Face Recognition from Masked Faces · [Paper](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-96040-7_40)
  ###  Springer - Part of the Communications in Computer and Information Science book series (CCIS, volume 1534) · Feb 18, 2022

    ![Siamese Neural Network](..\images\image_siamese.jpg)

    We propose a solution to the challenge of face recognition in the presence of occlusion, particularly relevant during the COVID-19 pandemic where masks obscure facial features. Leveraging a Siamese neural network, our proposed model achieves impressive results of 93% best-of-five accuracy and 84.71% mean accuracy for partial face-images, offering a promising approach to address this critical security concern



- ## Improved Localized Sleep Scheduling Techniques to Prolong WSN Lifetime · [Paper](https://www.scpe.org/index.php/scpe/article/view/1847)
  ###  Scalable Computing : Practise and Experience - Vol 22 No 1 (2021) · Feb 9, 2021

    This paper presents a novel approach to scheduling sensor activities in order to achieve full coverage while enhancing network lifetime in WSNs. By introducing a level-wise sleep scheduling mechanism and maintaining coverage through a routing tree, our method optimizes energy usage and prolongs network longevity. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating improved network lifetime by strategically putting more nodes into sleep mode while ensuring full coverage engagement only within the relevant areas 



- ## A feasible voice based Inhouse navigation system for the visually impaired · [Paper](https://www.cseij.org/vol10.html)
  ###  CSEIJ, vol10,Number1/2/3/4 August 2020 · Aug 15, 2020

    We propose the development of an in-house navigation system tailored for visually impaired individuals mainly marrying the concept between RFID hardware equipments and standard navigation algorithms, designed to be cost-effective, straightforward to implement, and exceptionally user-friendly. This system will enable blind or partially sighted individuals to navigate indoor premises such as offices, buildings, or floors effortlessly, even in the presence of turns, obstacles, and diverse locations.



- ## A Level-Wise Periodic Tree Construction Mechanism for Sleep Scheduling in WSN · [Paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9565996)
  ###  IEEE

    This paper introduces a novel approach to minimize energy consumption in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) through a level-wise sleep scheduling mechanism coupled with connectivity maintenance. By constructing and periodically updating a routing tree, we ensure network longevity and uniform power distribution among nodes. To prevent network holes during state transitions, active nodes communicate with their children before deactivation, transferring responsibility seamlessly to maintain connectivity. Our results demonstrate reduced energy consumption and sustained connectivity, with future work focusing on further analysis and avoidance of network holes.


- ## An AI Approach to Pose-based Sports Activity Classification · [Paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9565996)
  ###  Journal Of Communications Software and Systems VOL. 16, NO. 2, JUNE 2020 · Jun 1, 2020
    ![Tennis](..\images\tennis.png)


    Our proposed intelligent system utilizes computer vision architecture, specifically Detectron2, to analyze tennis gameplay. By employing activity-based pose estimation and classification, it accurately identifies tennis shots and evaluates player performance. This approach not only aids coaching staff but also provides valuable insights into player strengths and weaknesses. With a classification accuracy of 98.60 %, surpassing state-of-the-art CNN models, our system demonstrates significant potential for enhancing tennis training and analysis.

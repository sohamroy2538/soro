I hold a bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering and am currently pursuing my master's degree in Data Science and AI in Germany. Despite my specialization, I have the freedom to explore a wide range of courses and subjects related to Computer Science beyond my field at Saarland University . Driven by curiosity, I have ventured into diverse areas offered by the university and the prestigious research institutes like DFKI, CISPA, MPI to name a few that are sprawling across the university campus. Below is a summary of my educational journey:
